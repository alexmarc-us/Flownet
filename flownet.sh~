#### Backup method

	echo "Flowout: Prior backup for ${1} exists at ${LASTBACKUP}!"
    
	echo "Flowout: Attempting to restore files from ${LASTBACKUP} to remote location ${1}:${RESTORE}..."

	# rsync previous backup directory with desired location on remote server
	# -a = archive mode for symolic link, devices, attributes, permissions, and ownership preservation, same as -rlptgoD (no -H)
	# -r = recursive mode
	# -q = quiet mode, no output exept errors
	# -z = compression to reduce size of data portions

	fi

    else
